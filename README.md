Heavily referenced the ideas or straight up stole from: 

- im-izz/popfox
- cascadefox/cascade

Added tweaks that I prefer, this is probably going to be made private in the future, but I don't think it needs to be yet. 


Started with cascade because I liked the one liner, but later found popfox, however some of the features were broken, but at first i straight up slapped the two together, but overtime i kept removing more and more of cascades stuff, to the point I don't think there are anything related to it in here, however it still will remain mentioned since it is a good theme for people to use.
