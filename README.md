Heavily referenced the ideas or straight up stole from: 

- im-izz/popfox
- cascadefox/cascade

This is tested on Firefox Dev Edition, I do not use normal Firefox, as Dev Edition for me just runs hundreds of times better.

----

Started with cascade because I liked the one liner, but later found popfox, however some of the features were broken, but at first i straight up slapped the two together, but overtime i kept removing more and more of cascades stuff, to the point I don't think there are anything related to it in here, however it still will remain mentioned since it is a good theme for people to use.

Before applying please pin whatever extensions you actually use to before or after the tab bar, as there is no way to access most of them if they are click to use, otherwise familiarize yourself with keyboard shortcuts that you choose to use it. this is pretty much a keyboard css. even most of the right click options are just gone. good luck.

Extension Recommendations: Ublock Origin, Some new tab home page of choice (Mine is Tabliss), Password Manager of Choice
